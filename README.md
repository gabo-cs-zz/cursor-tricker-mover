# cursor-tricker-mover
A small desktop app that allows us to set the cursor to move by itself at a specific interval of time.
(It was developed some years ago now and I'm just githubing it today).

Its main purpose is to simulate the movement of the mouse pointer in case you can't do it through the computer settings for any reason. (This is what led me to do it, I was restricted to change the computer settings in an office and I went ahead and created this solution to prevent the screen from going to sleep and accomplish some other tasks, too).

You just have to specify the interval of time you want your pointer to be moving at, and then hit OK. You can also pause it, stop it and of course restart it.
